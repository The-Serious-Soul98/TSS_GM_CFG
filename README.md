# TSS_GM_CFG
My collection of GMod config files

The files will have it's commands commented where I feel things are not obvious but it should be mostly easy to figure out.

The vast majority of it is stuff I have cobbled together from research and being told how to alias things through source engine .cfgs.

The network commands were from mastercom's config files for TF2 with same code comments

The autoexec.cfg will only run commands that effect game preformance such as threading and clientside network cmds.

The later files with the prefix "tss_gm_" will be my personal keybinds and hook into the autoexec.

When the "tss_gm_" files are in "autoexec.cfg" will run "tss_gm_reset" which unbinds all keys, and replaces them with mostly default keys plus some alterations.

When tss_gm_reset is loaded "page down" will enable extra keybinds specific for the Zombie Survival GMod gamemode.

The idea being that after you close GMod and restart it, you wil not have any left over Zombie Survival keybinds when you restart the game to play another non-ZS gamemode 
and won't use ZS related keybindings.
